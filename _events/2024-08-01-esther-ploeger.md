title: "Language Similarity in Machine Translation: A Typological Perspective"
abstract: State-of-the-art performance in machine translation is currently achieved by training models on an ever larger amount of text. While this data-driven approach has increased translation quality substantially in some cases, languages for which little such data is available often remain underserved. Additionally, this approach is increasingly computationally expensive. Linguistic typology provides potential for mitigating these issues. Typologists have systematically analysed the similarities and differences between many of the world’s languages, resulting in comprehensive linguistic descriptions and databases. This talk will address challenges and opportunities in applying what we know about languages to make translation models more efficient and accurate in low-resource settings.
speaker: drs. Esther Ploeger
bio: Esther Ploeger is a PhD student at the Department of Computer Science at Aalborg University, Copenhagen. In her research, she focuses on leveraging knowledge about language and cross-linguistic tendencies (linguistic typology) in practical natural language processing applications, such as machine translation. Prior to this, she obtained a BSc. And MSc. in Information Science at the Univeristy of Groningen in The Netherlands.
