We attended the online version of WASSA (Workshop on Computational Approaches to Subjectivity, 
Sentiment and Social Media Analysis) collocated with ACL 2023 at Toronto, Canada. 
Kushal's work titled ['Transfer Learning for Code-Mixed Data: Do Pretraining Languages Matter?'](https://aclanthology.org/2023.wassa-1.32/) was published in the workshop proceedings, and she presented the paper as a poster at the workshop.
