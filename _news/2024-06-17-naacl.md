Thomas attended the [2024 NAACL conference](https://2024.naacl.org/) in Mexico City to present his first published paper, [*"BPE-knockout: Pruning Pre-existing BPE Tokenisers with Backwards-compatible Morphological Semi-supervision"*](https://aclanthology.org/2024.naacl-long.324/), in the form of a poster. A blog post in layman terms, with accompanying video presenting the work, can be found [here](https://pieter.ai/bpe-knockout/).
