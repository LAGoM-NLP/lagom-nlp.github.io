We attended the 33rd Meeting of [CLIN](https://clin33.uantwerpen.be/) (Computational Linguistics in the Netherlands), organized by CLiPS at the University of Antwerp. Kushal presented a poster at the meeting titled ['Transfer Learning for Code-Mixed Data: Do Pretraining Languages Matter?'](https://aclanthology.org/2023.wassa-1.32/), talking about her work on code-mixed NLP with pretrained language models.
