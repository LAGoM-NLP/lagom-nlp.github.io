Our group presented three papers at EMNLP, two oral presentations at the main conference, and one at the Multilingual Representation Learning Workshop!

* Kushal Tatariya presented our work on Pixology, where we attempt to interpret what Pixel learns about language/vision. Paper: [https://aclanthology.org/2024.emnlp-main.194/](https://aclanthology.org/2024.emnlp-main.194/)

* Wessel Poelman presented our work on typological diversity where we investigate what the community means when using this expression and if this use makes sense (spoiler alert: it doesn't). Paper: [https://aclanthology.org/2024.emnlp-main.326/](https://aclanthology.org/2024.emnlp-main.326/)

* Zeno Vandenbulcke and Lukas Vermeire investigated zero-shot POS tagging, looking at the impact of language relatedness and treebank quality on the success of cross-lingual transfer, as well as asking if it even makes sense to investigate zero-shot POS tagging. (virtually presented by Miryam de Lhoneux) Paper: [https://aclanthology.org/2024.mrl-1.9/](https://aclanthology.org/2024.mrl-1.9/)
