We are attending the [HumanCLAIM](https://clap-lab.github.io/workshop) Workshop at the Vrije Universiteit in Amsterdam on January 11.
Miryam will give a talk about Fairness in Multilingual NLP, Kushal is presenting a poster about emotion classification for code-mixed data, and Wessel will present a poster about how typological diversity is reported on in NLP research.

We hope to see you there!
